# 3.Design a simulation study 1

- Fit a regression model to the simulated data while assuming that data are i.i.d and normally distributed

- Conduct a simulation study that varies sample sizes, correlation levels, or degree of non-normality to assess bias in parameter estimates, type I error in hypothesis testing and coverage in conference intervals.

- Demonstrate how inference changes as the severity of assumption deviation increases (more skew, heavier tail, stronger correlation)
